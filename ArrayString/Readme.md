1.1 Is Unique: Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. What if you cannot use additional data structures?
- ASCII or Unicode
- 128 characters in ASCII
- 256 characters in extended ASCII

1.2 Check Permutation: Given two strings, write a method to decide if one is a permutation of the other.
- Permutation: changing the linear order of an ordered set.
- Permutation comparison is case sensitive and whitespace is significant.
- ASCII or Unicode

1.3 URLify: Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20'.
- Edit the string starting from the end and working backwards.
- Use character arrays, because Java strings are immutable.
